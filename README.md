## Installing Hugo on Your Machine

In most cases, the Hugo executable can simply be downloaded and added to your path.

If your OS has a package manager installed (brew on OSX, chocolatey on Windows, apt/dnf/yum on GNU/Linux)
you will be able to install a recent version of hugo with `<pkg> install hugo`. For example, here's what
installation could look like on Windows 10:

```
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> choco install hugo
Chocolatey v0.10.15
Installing the following packages:
hugo
By installing you accept licenses for the packages.
Progress: Downloading hugo 0.76.4... 100%

...install logs are printed...

Chocolatey installed 1/1 packages.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).
```
